GLAI: iOS App for Golang Code Generation, Debugging, and Testing

**📌 Project Overview**

Vectro Consulting Services invites iOS developers, Go enthusiasts, and open-source contributors to collaborate on a groundbreaking, community-driven mobile project — GLAI: an iOS application that empowers users to generate, debug, enhance, and test Golang code using natural language prompts.

GLAI is designed for developers, hobbyists, and learners who want to write and manage Go code on-the-go. Whether you're building a small CLI, testing a REST API snippet, or learning the language, GLAI gives you the power of AI and Golang in your pocket.
